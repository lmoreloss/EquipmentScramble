# Equipment Scramble
Just a tiny game made for Untitled Game Jam #109 (https://itch.io/jam/untitled-game-jam-109). The theme was "One Location".
The gameplay is go around the city block collecting filming equipment (Cameras, Greenscreens, Generators and Lights) and deliver them to the "Headquarters". The theme is achieved with the way the game takes places in a city block and the player needs to deliver the equipment to the headquarters.

## Why?
To remember how to participate in a game jam

## Features I would have loved to implement
- NPC's roaming around
- NPC's filming or acting
- More variety of equipment (thaks to spaghetti this became a tangled mess with just 4 types)
- A bigger city
